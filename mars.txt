Space X launched a rocket to Mars today. Mars is cold and dry, but vampires and werewolves don't care 
They can drive the Tesla, or ride with the Spaceman and the dog. 
The dog and the werewolf may bond. 
I love Git and Git Hub, but they may not love me. 
I own the thing about rockets now. Haha Sarah.
